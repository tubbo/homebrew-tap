# tubbo's homebrew tap

A collection of [Homebrew][brew] formulae that I've either collected
over the years or added myself for installing my own software.

To use it, run the following command:

```bash
$ brew tap tubbo/tap
```

Now you'll be able to use formulae in this repo with Homebrew:

```bash
$ brew install homer
$ brew install rails-template
$ brew install macvim_drawer
```
