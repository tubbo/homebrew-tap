# tubbo's homebrew tap

A collection of [Homebrew][brew] formulae that I've either collected
over the years or added myself for installing my own software.

To use it, run the following command:

```bash
$ brew tap tubbo/tap
```

Now you'll be able to use formulae in this repo with Homebrew:

```bash
$ brew install homer
$ brew install rails-template
$ brew install macvim_drawer
```

## Formulae

Here is a short list of formulae in this repo:

- [homer][homer]: A shell framework for ZSH that emphasizes convention
  over configuration, minimalist beauty, and enhanced shell productivity.
- [macvim_drawer][macvim]: Builds [alloy][alloy]'s fork of MacVim, which
  includes a project drawer similar to the one found in TextMate.
- [rails-template][rt]: The application template that I use to build
  [Ruby on Rails][rails] apps, as well as the supporting files it
  requires.
